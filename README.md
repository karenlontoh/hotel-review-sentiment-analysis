# Hotel Reviews Sentiment Analysis 🏨💬🤖
Create a sentiment analysis model for hotel reviews using NLP techniques and TensorFlow, deployed to streamline feedback assessment and enhance customer experience.

## Introduction 🌍
Customer reviews play an essential role in the hospitality industry, impacting a hotel's reputation and influencing the decisions of potential guests. By analyzing customer sentiment through reviews, hotels can gain valuable insights into guest satisfaction, identify areas for improvement, and enhance their services. This project develops a deep learning model to classify hotel reviews based on ratings into sentiment categories (negative, neutral, positive), empowering hotel managers to take a data-driven approach to improve customer experiences.

## Dataset Overview 📊
The dataset for this project consists of customer reviews sourced from the TripAdvisor app, a platform for travelers to share experiences and find travel recommendations. The dataset includes:
- `Review`: Customer feedback in text form.
- `Rating`: A numerical score from 1 to 5 indicating satisfaction.

### Categories
- **Negative** (1-2)
- **Neutral** (3)
- **Positive** (4-5)
